          <h4>Letâ€™s start with what public goods actually are. </h4>

<p>In economics, a public good is a good that is both non-excludable and non-rivalrous, so individuals cannot be excluded from use, and use by one individual does not reduce availability to others. A public good can also be used simultaneously by more than one person.</p> 

<p>To illustrate the difference between public goods and other goods such as common, private or club goods, letâ€™s have a look at a few examples. </p>

<p>All goods can be classified by their excludability and by their rivalry.</p>
