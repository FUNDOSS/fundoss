Start the development server by running `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`. The project supports using `.env`. Getting started by create a `.env` file with the above variables.

#### `.env`

I include my own environment variables in [.env.example](.env.example) for experimentation purposes. Please replace them with your owns and refrain from sabotaging them. You can try them in development by renaming it into `.env`.

In production, it is recommended to set the environment variables using the options provided by your cloud/hosting providers. **Do not use or commit `.env`**.

<h2 align="center">Deployment</h2>

This project can be deployed [anywhere Next.js can be deployed](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment). Make sure to set the environment variables using the options provided by your cloud/hosting providers.

After building using `npm run build`, simply start the server using `npm run start`.
